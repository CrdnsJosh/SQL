#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from the top 50 songs of 2021.
#I created a table to insert the Spotify data into and down below you can see the analytics I performed using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

#After creating the table I inserted the Spotify data .csv into the table.
#Down below are a few queries I made with the data presented.

#With these first two queries I determined the top 10 songs with the most energy and the most danceability.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10;

SELECT artist_name,track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;

#The following query is showcasing who the artists are behind the top 10 most popular songs in this list
SELECT artist_name,track_name,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc, artist_name
LIMIT 10;

#These last two queries identify the song(s) with the highest tempo and lowest tempo(both as BPM)
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(TEMPO) AS BPM
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MIN(TEMPO) AS BPM
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
